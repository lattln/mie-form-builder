## Export

The MIE Form Builder allows you to export the structure of your forms as JSON. This feature enables you to save the form configuration and load it later or use it in another application.

To export a form as JSON:

1. Build your form using the drag and drop interface.
2. Click the "Export" button.
3. The JSON structure of your form will be generated and available for download.

## Import

You can also import a JSON structure to load a pre-defined form configuration. This feature is useful for reusing form templates or loading forms saved from previous sessions.

To import a form from JSON:

1. Click the "Import" button.
2. Upload your JSON file.
3. The form builder will load the form configuration from the JSON and render it in the interface.
